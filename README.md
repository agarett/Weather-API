# Weather-API
**Weather API Project**

**Summary**
This project involved using the Open Weather Map API to pull current weather information from over 500 cities across the world. The Citipy library was used to select cities based on a randomly generated list of latitudes and longitudes. Current temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed were then added to a dataframe and graphed to see how weather changes in relation to latitude and the Equator.

**Key Findings**

1. Temperature increased towards the equator, and peaked between 0 and 40 degrees North, which includes regions known for being very hot including: The Middle East, Northern Africa, and Southern Asia. 

2. Humidity in most cities tended to range between 60% and 100%, and peaked between 0 and 40 degrees South in longitude. This makes sense when you consider regions like the Amazon rainforest, and Southern Asia and Africa. 

3. Cloudiness did not show a clear correlation with latitude. Wind speed appears to increase a bit further from the equator, but the correlation is not clear.
